Whether it's the discovery of the Higgs boson or searching for Dark Matter, physicists boost trillions of collision events into the center-of-mass frame. It isolates the intrinsic properties of the collision products, completely independent of how fast the initial incoming particles were moving in the laboratory tunnel. By building these tools from scratch, the abstract math finally becomes an intuitive geometrical reality!\\n"
